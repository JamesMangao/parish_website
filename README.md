## Legal, Compliance & Accessibility

| Area | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Cookie consent | Alpine `cookieConsent()` component in `components/public-layout.blade.php` (bottom banner, `role="region"`). Shown until the visitor chooses; choice persisted in `localStorage` key `parish_cookie_consent` |
| Analytics opt-in | GA4 is **only** injected after "Accept All" — gtag script appended with `anonymize_ip: true`, guarded by `window.__gaLoaded`. "Essential Only" sets consent without loading anything |
| Analytics config | `GTM_ID` env var → `config/services.php` (`analytics.gtm_id`). The "Accept All" button is hidden when unset (see GA4 Measurement ID setup below) |
| Form consent | `consent` field added to inquiry, mass intention, and donation forms with `required\|accepted` validation in `InquiryController`, `IntentionController`, and `DonationController` plus custom error messages; front-end gating too |
| Privacy pages | `privacy-policy.blade.php` and `terms.blade.php` behind `/privacy-policy` and `/terms` routes, linked in the footer Quick Links; consent labels link to both |
| Embed privacy | Third-party embeds hardened: YouTube uses `youtube-nocookie.com/embed` (`live-mass-slot`, `album-show`) and the Facebook plugin sets `dnt=1` |
| Accessibility | Global `:focus-visible` outlines (`resources/css/app.css`), pre-existing skip-link in the public layout, `aria-label` on the back-to-top button, corrected heading hierarchy, and WCAG AA contrast fixes (stat labels, eyebrows, chatbot timestamps) |

#### GA4 Measurement ID setup

1. Google Analytics → Admin → **Create property** (e.g. "Sto. Rosario Parish Website").
2. Admin → **Data Streams → Add stream → Web** → enter `https://sto-rosario-parish.onrender.com`.
3. Copy the **Measurement ID** (format `G-XXXXXXXXXX`) from the stream page — this is your `GTM_ID`.
4. On Render: service **Environment → Add Environment Variable** → `GTM_ID` = your ID → redeploy.
   *(GTM_ID is read at runtime — no `config:cache` in the deploy path, so no file changes needed. Never put it in `.env` for production; `.env` is gitignored and not deployed.)*

## Requirements

- PHP 8.4+
- Composer
- Node.js 20+
- npm

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JamesMangao/parish_website
   cd parish-website
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install Node dependencies and build assets**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Configure your `.env`** with the following keys:
   - Database settings (SQLite by default)
   - `SUPABASE_*` keys for cloud storage
   - `GROQ_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for AI chatbot
   - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` and `GOOGLE_SHARE_EMAIL` for Slides integration
   - `GCASH_NUMBER`, `MAYA_NUMBER`, `BANK_DETAILS` for donation info
   - `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY`, `PAYMONGO_PUBLIC_KEY`, `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for payment processing
   - `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`, `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID`, `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` for Facebook Live webhook
   - `GTM_ID` (optional) for consent-gated Google Analytics — see [GA4 setup](#ga4-measurement-id-setup)

6. **Run migrations**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Seed sample data** (optional)
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

8. **Create an admin user**
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   ```
   ```php
   User::create(['name' => 'Admin', 'email' => 'admin@example.com', 'password' => bcrypt('password'), 'role' => 'super_admin', 'is_active' => true]);
   ```

9. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   composer dev
   ```
   This runs the artisan server, queue worker, pail log viewer, and Vite dev server concurrently.

## Docker

A multi-stage Dockerfile is included for containerized deployment:

```bash
docker build -t parish-pal .
docker run -p 80:80 parish-pal
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:80`.

**Multi-stage build:** Stage 1 uses `node:20-alpine` to compile frontend assets; Stage 2 uses `php:8.4-fpm-alpine` with Nginx for production serving. Includes opcache + JIT tuning, upload limits (128M/256M), and on-demand PHP-FPM.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on **Render** with:
- **Web service** (`parish-website`) — Docker-based, runs the Laravel app behind Nginx
- **Worker service** (`parish-queue-worker`) — runs `php artisan queue:work --tries=3 --timeout=60 --sleep=3` for background jobs (donation receipts, gallery uploads, activity logs, inquiry notifications)
- **Scheduled task** — `chat:prune-stale` runs hourly to resolve abandoned chat sessions

See `render.yaml` for the full infrastructure-as-code configuration.

## Testing

```bash
php artisan test
```

Tests use SQLite `:memory:`, array cache, sync queue, and array mail driver. CI runs on GitHub Actions (PHP 8.4 + Node 20 + MySQL 8.0).
